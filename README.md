### Course structure:
The first half of the course we will cover the basics if programming with Python, and progress to more advanced topics and libraries such as Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib.  We then cover the fundamentals of Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability and Statistics.

### Homeworks:
Most lessons will have a set of homeworks and solutions.  Try to work through the problems on your own (it is OK to discuss with your peers and instructors), and then review the solutions.  The homeworks are not graded and do not need to be submitted.

### Before the Course Begins (Prework):
* We use Slack to facilitate communication.  Join the Slack Channel!
* Your Metis Live Online session will take place via Zoom.
* The recordings for the class will be uploaded within 24 hours to the Google Drive folder.
* **Pre-work:** Please install and verify the [installation of Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos) (for Python 3) by running a "Hello World" sample code before the first day of class.
1. The file titled [Lecture_0_Part1.pdf](https://github.com/thisismetis/lol20_bpm19_jan13/blob/master/Python/Lecture_0_Part1.pdf) is a PDF that you can open without any additional software. This document will go through all the necessary steps of downloading Anaconda and verifying that it has been downloaded correctly. 
2. The second file titled "Lecture_0_Part2.ipynb" is a Jupyter Notebook file that you should only open AFTER following the instructions in the file above, otherwise you will not know what to do with this file.
