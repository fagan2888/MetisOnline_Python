    "- Comments are the way programmers annotate their programs with the intention of making it easy for other humans (and themselves) to understand\n",

    "__Helpful Points:__\n",
    "1. If you are performing an arithmetic operation using an `int` AND `float`, the result will become a type `float`\n",
    "2. The `^` symbol in Python is NOT the exponent, instead it refers to the [Bitwise Operation XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) (more on this below)\n",
    "3. Dividing by zero produces an error (`ZeroDivisionError: division by zero`)\n",

    "- __[Bitwise Operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation):__ Bitwise Operation applies Boolean Operators to the individual bits of integers that are used in the operation. Bitwise Operation requires converting each numeric value in the expression to its equivalent bits representation. There are 3 types of Bitwise Operators as described below:\n",
    "> 1. `&` (Bitwise `AND` operation) -> returns 1 if both bits are 1, 0 otherwise \n",
    "> 2. `|` (Bitwise `OR` operation - inclusive) -> returns 1 if either bit is 1, 0 otherwise  \n",
    "> 3. `^` (Bitwise `XOR` operation - exclusive) -> returns 1 if the bits are different, 0 if they are the same \n",
    "\n",
    "__Helpful Points:__\n",
    "1. Bitwise Operation is different than Boolean Operation in a few key ways. Without going into too much detail for this Basic Python course, here are the practical differences you should know:\n",
    "> - Boolean Operators (`and` and `or`) are usually used on Boolean Values (see section 1.10.1) to produce a Boolean Value, whereas Bitwise Operators (`&` and `|`) are usually used on Integer Values (see section 1.7) to produce an Integer Value\n",
