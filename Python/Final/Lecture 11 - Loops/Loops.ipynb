    "- __Loops__: Loops are another cornerstone of programming and allow programmers to repeat steps multiple times until some condition is met or the condition has reached the pre-specified number of iterations \n",
    "- The condition in a loop is important as it determines how long the loop will run for \n",
    "- After each __[iteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration)__, the loop checks the condition. If the condition tells the loop to continue, another iteration will commence. If the condition tells the loop to stop, the loop will end. \n",
    "- For example, if you wanted to print \"Hello World\" 10 times, you can easily write 10 statements that look like this: `print(\"Hello World\")`, but this would not be the most efficient way of performing this task\n",
    "- Instead, you can leverage a loop to repeat the statement `print(\"Hello World\")` by enclosing the statemenet in a loop and telling the loop to repeat this task 10 times \n",

    "__Overview:__\n",
    "- The last concept required to program loops in Python are the built-in statements that allow more advanced control of loops (both `for` and `while` loops)\n",
    "- There are 4 \"advanced control statements\" in Python:\n",
    "> 1. __[break](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/simple_stmts.html#break):__ Break statements allow you to \"exit\" the loop before the condition is actually met. The `break` statement will break out of the innermost enclosing `for` or `while` loop, skipping the optional `else` clause (if present)\n",
    "> 2. __[continue](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/simple_stmts.html#continue):__ Continue statements continues to the next iteration of the loop \n",
    "> 3. __[pass](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/simple_stmts.html#pass):__ Pass statements don't do anything, but are used when a statement is used syntactically (required for the program to run), but the program requires no action. Pass statements are also used as placeholders \n",
    "> 4. __[else](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/compound_stmts.html#else):__ Else statements can be used in loops in a slightly similar fashion as they are used in If Statements. A loop's `else` clause runs when no `break` occurs. Therefore, an `else` clause actually resembles more of a `try` and `except` clause which will be discussed later. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Helpful Points:__\n",
    "1. These statements allow you to have more control over the body of your loops (i.e. stop the loop pre-maturely, skip over an iteration, etc.)\n",
    "2. These statements work in both `for` and `while` loops\n",
