    "__Overview:__\n",
    "- __[Methods](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/classes.html#method-objects):__ Methods are a specific type of function that \"belongs\" to an object\n",
    "- Each object (for example, a `list`) has many \"capabilities\" (i.e. a `list` object is capable of the following: `append`, `remove`, `insert`, `count`, `extend`, etc.)\n",
    "- You can think of these \"capabilities\" as functions that ONLY lists are capable of (and therefore, `str` objects are not capable of) \n",
    "- These \"internal\" capabilities (functions) are strictly called __Methods__ since they are not stand-alone functions that you can use with any object, instead they are specific to the object they belong to\n",
    "- The general form of a __Method__ is: `obj.methodname()` where `obj` is some object and `methodname` is the name of a method that belongs to the object (or we can say the name of the function for illustrative purposes) \n",
    "\n",
    "__Helpful Points:__ \n",
    "1. To fully understand Methods, you will have to learn about __[Classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming))__ and __Objects__ within the __[Object Oriented Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)__ framework. However, this is out of the scope of this course and we will only learn what is necessary at this stage \n",
    "2. We have already seen many Methods for objects that were created as `list` and `str` types \n",
    "3. The parentheses `(` and `)` denote the arguments that are passed into the method in the same way thar arguments were passed into functions above \n",
    "4. It is possible to call a method on an object without any values insde the `(` and `)` because what happens is that the `obj` is actually passed in as an argument by default \n",
