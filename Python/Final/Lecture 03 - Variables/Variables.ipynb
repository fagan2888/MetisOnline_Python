    "\n",
    "__Helpful Points:__\n",
    "1. You have the luxury of naming variables according to any name you wish\n",
    "2. However, there are some constraints/rules you must follow:\n",
    ">a. Variable names are case sensitive so the variable `a` is different than the variable `A`<br>\n",
    ">b. There are a list of \"reserved\" names in Python that you should not use to name variables. You can find a complete list of reserved words [here](https://docs.python.org/2.5/ref/keywords.html). You will notice a variable name is a Python keyword because as you type it, the text will turn <font color=\"green\">green</font> <br>\n",
    ">c. Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore but the remainder of the variable can consist of letters, numbers and underscores<br>\n",
    ">d. Multi-variable names can not be separated by a dot (`.`) since this denotes a method \n",
    "3. Additionally, there are some best practices you should follow:\n",
    ">a. Multi-variable names are usually separated by an underscore (`clark_kent` is more readable than `clarkkent`)<br>\n",
    ">b. Variable names should be descriptive and therefore random letters such as a, b, c should be avoided<br>\n",
    ">c. Avoid misleading letters such as the letter (`l`) since it looks remarkably similar to the number (`1`) and the capital letter (`O`) since it looks remarkably similar to the number (`0`)\n",
