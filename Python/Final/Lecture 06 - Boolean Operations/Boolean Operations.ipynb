    "- __[Boolean Operations](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#boolean-operations):__ Boolean Operations refer to the operations that involve the Boolean Operators. There are 3 common types of Boolean Operators as described below:\n",
    "> 1. `and` (`x and y` returns `True` if `x` and `y` are both `True`)\n",
    "> 2. `or` (`x or y` returns `True` if `x` or `y` is `True`)\n",
    "> 3. `not` (`x and not y` means the opposite of `y`)\n",
    "- The result of a Boolean Operation is one of the two Boolean Values (`True` or `False`)\n",
