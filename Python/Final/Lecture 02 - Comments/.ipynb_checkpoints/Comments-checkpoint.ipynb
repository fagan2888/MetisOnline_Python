    "__Overview:__\n",
    "- Before we begin writing our first program, it is necessary to highlight an important concept for programming - [Comments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comment_(computer_programming))\n",
    "- Comments are the way programmers annotate their programs with the intention of making it easy for other humans (and themselves) to understand\n",
    "- When a computer program is run, comments should be ignored or passed over. Therefore, we need a way of telling the  [interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)) that we are writing a comment and NOT actual code \n",
    "- Every computer programming language has different syntax to denote comments, but in Python the `#` (the hash character or [number sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign)) symbol is used\n",
    "\n",
    "__Helpul Points:__\n",
    "1. There are certain universal guides for commenting that you should follow. In general, comments should explain WHY not WHAT (with some exceptions). For example, here are some uses of commenting:\n",
    "> a. Explaining something to the reader that may not be obvious<br>\n",
    "> b. Clarifying your intention behind a line or block of code<br>\n",
    "> c. Setting a reminder to change or input something in the future<br> \n",
    "2. Additionally, there are guides of how NOT to comment. For example, explaining every variable assignment is considered unnecessary and overkill \n",
    "3. See [this](https://blog.codinghorror.com/code-tells-you-how-comments-tell-you-why/) blogpost for a more philosophical discussion around commenting \n",
    "4. In Python, comments can only extend one line (__Single-Line Comments__). However, in the case of a function, an explanation of the function (\"docstring\") is given as a quasi __Multi-Line Comment__, but technically it is just a multi-line string denoted with triple quotes (`\"\"\"`)\n",
